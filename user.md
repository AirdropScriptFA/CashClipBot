## 🔍 How to Get Your Telegram User ID

You can get your Telegram **User ID** in two easy ways:

---

### ✅ Method 1 – From Bot Start Link

If you were invited or shared a bot link like this:

```
https://t.me/CashClipBot?start=2024951199
```

Then the number at the end (`2024951199`) is your **Telegram User ID**.

📌 Example:

```
Link: https://t.me/CashClipBot?start=2024951199
User ID: 2024951199
```

### ✅ Method 2 – Using @MissRose_bot

1. Open Telegram.
2. Search and start the bot: [@MissRose_bot](https://t.me/MissRose_bot)
3. Send this command:

```
/info
```

4. The bot will respond like:

```
Your Telegram ID is: 2024951199
```

> 🧠 This works in both private chats and groups.

💬 **Why do you need it?**  
The User ID helps bots identify you uniquely, even if your username changes.
